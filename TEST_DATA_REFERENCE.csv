BALANCE CALCULATION EXAMPLES
Example 1: EARNED Leave Balance
Opening Balance: 15 days (from last year carry-forward, max 60)
Year Start: 2025-01-01
Today: 2025-11-15 (11.5 months elapsed)
Monthly Accrual: 2 days/month
Months Completed: 11 months = 11 days earned + 1 day from Nov = 12 days total accrued
Used so far: 5 days (from approved leaves)
Current Balance: 15 + 12 - 5 = 22 days available

Example 2: CASUAL Leave Balance
Annual allocation: 10 days (no carry-forward)
Year Start: 2025-01-01
Months Elapsed: 11.5 months
Accrued this year: (11.5 / 12) * 10 = 9.58 ≈ 9-10 days
Used so far: 2 days
Current Balance: 10 - 2 = 8 days available (or 9.58 if calculated monthly)

Example 3: MEDICAL Leave Balance
Annual allocation: 14 days (no carry-forward)
Year Start: 2025-01-01
Months Elapsed: 11.5 months
Accrued: (11.5 / 12) * 14 = 13.4 ≈ 13-14 days
Used so far: 3 days
Current Balance: 14 - 3 = 11 days available

TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL TESTING
Tip Category,Tip,Example
Data Entry,"Always use exact data from this reference sheet","Type: employee1@demo.local not employee1 @ demo.local"
Dates,"When tests say 'future date' use 2025-11-24+","Not a random date. Consistency matters."
Passwords,"Always use demo123 for all demo accounts","Not 'demo' or 'password' or 'demo12'."
Wait Times,"Allow 2-3 seconds for pages to load","Don't click submit twice. Wait for response."
Error Messages,"Read error messages carefully - they tell you what's wrong","'Insufficient notice' vs 'Insufficient balance' - different fixes"
Status Codes,"Look for Status column if testing APIs","Each test has expected status in test sheet."
Clear Cache,"Between test cycles, clear browser cache if issues arise","Dev Tools -> Clear site data. Or test in incognito."
Take Notes,"Write observations in 'Notes' column while testing","Helps track patterns and remember details."
Screenshots,"Take screenshots of errors or unusual behavior","Paste filename in 'Screenshot' column."
Ask for Help,"If test keeps failing, check this reference sheet first","99% of issues are data entry or timing."
