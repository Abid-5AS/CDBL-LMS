You are an expert UX Researcher and Product Designer. You have been given a comprehensive set of documentation and source code for the "CDBL Leave Management System".

**Your Objective:**
Analyze the provided materials to deeply understand the system from the perspective of its users. You need to produce a detailed research report and design brief.

**Input Materials:**
- `dashboard_code/`: The actual React/Next.js code for the dashboards.
- `components_code/`: The UI components used.
- `schema.prisma`: The database schema.
- `current_functionalities.md`: A summary of what currently exists.
- Various Audit Reports and Guides (`.md` files) which contain previous analyses and improvement plans.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Role Analysis:**
    For each of the following roles: **Employee, Manager, HR Admin, System Admin**.
    - **Needs:** What are they trying to achieve? (e.g., "Quickly book time off", "Ensure team coverage").
    - **Pain Points & Frustrations:** Based on the code (complexity, error handling) and audit reports, what is likely annoying or difficult for them?
    - **Importance:** Rank the features they use by frequency and criticality.

2.  **Page & Layout Recommendations:**
    For each role's dashboard:
    - **Ideal Layout:** Describe the optimal arrangement of widgets, tables, and actions.
    - **Key Cards/Widgets:** What specific information needs to be visible *immediately*? (e.g., "Remaining Balance" vs. "Team Calendar").
    - **Information Architecture:** How should navigation be structured?

3.  **Prompt Generation:**
    Finally, generate a specific, high-quality prompt that I can feed back into an AI coding agent to *implement* these improvements. This prompt should be technical and actionable.

**Output Format:**
Please structure your response as a structured report with clear headings for each role. Conclude with the "Implementation Prompt".
