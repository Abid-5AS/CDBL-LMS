IMPORTANT NOTES FOR OCD/ADHD-FRIENDLY TESTING
- Each test is self-contained and step-numbered
- Test data is provided - no need to improvise
- Expected results are explicit - you know exactly what success looks like
- Status column has emoji checkboxes - easy to mark
- Keep notes brief - one line is fine
- Don't worry about perfect testing order - do what feels right
- Break into smaller sessions if needed - each test is ~5-15 minutes
- Save your progress frequently in the CSV
- You can pause and resume anytime

COLOR CODING (Apply in Excel)
- Red background = Failed test (needs investigation)
- Green background = Passed test
