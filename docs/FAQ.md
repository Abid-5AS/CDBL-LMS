## Balances & Calculations

### How is my leave balance calculated?

**Earned Leave:** 2 days per month × months of service
**Casual Leave:** 14 days on January 1st each year
**Medical Leave:** 14 days on January 1st each year

### What happens to unused Casual and Medical Leave?

They **do not carry forward** to the next year. They expire on December 31st.

### Can Earned Leave be carried forward?

Yes! Earned Leave can accumulate up to 120 days and carries forward indefinitely.

### Why is my projected balance showing negative?

This means you're requesting more days than you have available. You can still submit (system may allow with approval), but you'll need HR Head or CEO approval.

### What are conversions?

When your Earned Leave exceeds 60 days, the excess (beyond 60) is automatically converted to Special Leave at a 2:1 ratio. Example: 75 EL days → 60 EL + 7.5 Special Leave.

### Can I encash my leave?

Yes, if you have:
- Minimum 5 years of service
- At least 15 days Earned Leave balance
- Maximum 30 days per year can be encashed

### How much money do I get for encashment?

Encashment is paid at your daily basic salary rate: `(Basic Salary ÷ 30) × Days Encashed`

## Approvals

### Who approves my leave request?

**Standard flow:**
1. HR Admin (initial review)
2. Department Head
3. HR Head (for extended or special leaves)

### How long does approval take?

- HR Admin: 1 business day
- Department Head: 2 business days
- HR Head: 3 business days
- CEO: 5 business days

### What if my approver is on leave?

The system automatically escalates to the next level approver after the standard timeframe.

### Can I see who has approved my request?

### Why was my leave returned for modification?

The approver needs you to provide additional information or documents. Check their comment for specific instructions.

## Special Cases

### What is a fitness certificate and when do I need it?

If you take Medical Leave for more than 7 consecutive days, you must submit a **Fitness Certificate** from a registered doctor before returning to work. This certifies you're fit to resume duties.
