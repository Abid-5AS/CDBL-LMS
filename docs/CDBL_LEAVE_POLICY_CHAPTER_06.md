# CHAPTER 06 – WORKING HOURS & LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS

## 6.1 WORKING HOURS
Office hours in all CDBL offices normally is from 9am – 5pm, Sunday through Thursday, with an hour for lunch and prayer, from 1 to 2pm. These working hours may be adjusted during Ramadan and at other times due to unusual events as decided by management.

---

## 6.2 DAILY ATTENDANCE
Computerized system is in use to keep track of attendance by HRD. This electronic attendance log is used to monitor punctual arrival or absence from the office, travel, illness, etc. Failure to register through the biometric automated attendance system shall be treated as absence from duty requiring an adequate explanation. Department Heads / Supervisors are responsible for taking appropriate disciplinary action against such employees under intimation to HRD.

---

## 6.3 EFFICIENCY, PERFORMANCE, ABSENCE & TARDINESS
- It is expected that the normal working hours will be worked to complete the work assigned to an employee as outlined in his/her job description. When specifying roles and responsibilities included in the job descriptions, it must be ensured that they can be completed within the normal working hours.
- In order to maximize staff efficiency and performance it is important that working hours normally remain within the time limits specified above. Maintaining a proper work-life balance is important for staff motivation and performance, and managers should discourage staff from working longer hours unless otherwise required in order to achieve personal and the organization's objectives.
- Promptness and dependability in reporting to work at the scheduled start time are essential for effective customer service and uninterrupted workflow, and are job requirements for all employees.
- It is inevitable that employees will be absent, but it is important to note that recurring, unscheduled absences have adverse effects on business results, productivity, workflow, morale, and customer service. If an employee requires an absence, it is the employee's responsibility to notify his or her Department Head / Supervisor within one hour of the scheduled start time, and provide a reason for the absence. The employee is expected to make the call, except in an emergency situation when it is appropriate for someone else to call in. Failure to report an absence may result in disciplinary action.

---

## 6.4 OVERTIME WORK
Employees may be required to work additional hours when operational or contingency needs arise. All overtime calculations will be governed by Bangladesh Labor Law as provided below:

**Overtime Payment = (Hourly pay rate x 2)**

**Hourly pay calculation:**
- One Day Salary = Gross Salary / 22 (days)
- One Hour Salary = One Day Salary / 8 Hours

---

## 6.5 ON-CALL DUTIES
In exceptional cases, there may be a need for employees to be on-call outside normal working hours to handle operational or contingency matters. If the matters cannot be dealt with over the telephone, CDBL may require the employees to return to the workplace for emergency action. Extra hours worked may be compensated in accordance with the policy and procedure governing overtime compensation. In addition to overtime compensation, the employees would be entitled to food allowances at actual and a special allowance in case s/he is to work overnight or on weekends as per the following:

- Executive Cadre – BDT 1,500
- General Service Staff – BDT 700

In special circumstances / very long hour worked over weekend or holidays etc. a higher allowance may be paid at the discretion of the Managing Director & CEO.

---

## 6.6 ABSENTEEISM GUIDELINES
Absences are calculated on a rolling 12-month period. An absence is defined as:
- A single day of absence or major part thereof, or
- Consecutive days of absence without information/authority
- Habitual delay in attending office
- Habitually leaving office early

The following instances would be exceptions to this definition:
- Previously scheduled and approved leave
- Limited unscheduled, approved leave used for an emergency (based on management discretion and prior attendance history)

Excessive absenteeism may result in disciplinary action. A guideline as to what generally constitutes excessive absenteeism is set forth below; however, management discretion may alter this process based on individual and business circumstances:
- Absence during a month
- absences in a 3 month period
- absences in a 6 month period
- absences in a 9 month period
- absences in a 12 month period

Like absenteeism, tardiness makes it difficult to maintain customer service and workflow. Tardiness is defined as a late arrival for work in the morning, after breaks or after lunch. It is the expectation that individuals are prepared to begin work at the start of their scheduled time. It is understood that there are some circumstances beyond one's control that will lead to a late arrival. However, disciplinary actions will be enforced if excessive or a pattern of tardiness has been identified.

The following examples can be viewed as excessive or a pattern of tardiness:
- Consistently arriving 10-15 minutes or beyond 15 minutes later than expected
- Consistently arriving late with an unreasonable or no excuse
- 6 or more late to work beyond 15 minutes in a rolling 30 day period.
- Repeated tardiness even after verbal counseling on the matter.
